> “A condominium association... must post copies of the official records on its website... no later than 30 days after the document is created or received by the association.”  
> — [Florida House Bill 913, 2023](https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2023/913)

## A Legal Deadline with Real Teeth

Starting **January 1, 2026**, every Florida condominium association with **25 to 149 units** must:

- Maintain a **public-facing website or portal**
- Post the **last 12 months of approved board meeting minutes**
- Do so within **30 days of creation or receipt**

Failure to comply can result in **Department of Business and Professional Regulation (DBPR)** citations, **$5,000 fines**, and **personal liability for board members**.

## Who’s Legally Responsible?

While community association managers (CAMs) often upload documents, **the board of directors holds ultimate legal liability**. HB 913 expands what must be posted—and tightens the timeline. It does not shield directors who delegate responsibility and then fail to follow up.

> “The failure of a condominium association to post required documents... may be considered a willful failure to comply with this chapter.”  
> — [Chapter 718.111(12)(g), Florida Statutes](https://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0700-0799/0718/Sections/0718.111.html)

## What Must Be Posted?

Per HB 913 and the expanded requirements under Florida Statute §718.111:

- Approved board meeting minutes (12-month rolling)
- Bylaws, declarations, articles of incorporation
- Current budget and financial statements
- Reserve studies and inspection reports (SIRS)
- Bids and signed contracts over $2,500
- Board meeting notices and agendas
- Conflict-of-interest disclosures (new under HB 1021)
- **Hyperlinks to virtual meeting recordings** (if applicable)

---

## What If You Don’t?

- **Fines up to $5,000 per violation**
- **Lawsuits from unit owners** for wrongful record withholding
- **Loss of insurance coverage**: D&O policies may exclude claims tied to noncompliance
- **Forced audits** or state intervention from DBPR
